The src directory houses a file called input.txt.  The first line of this file
denotes the size of one row of the map. Meaning, the overall mapsize is the 
(first line)^2.  Every line after that represents a new drone with a target 
equal to the number on the line. In order to run different simulations,
you should edit this file following the above guidelines then run the make
command from the root directory.

Once make has completed, type ./dcas to run the simulation

Observe as the map simulates the input.  The square in the top left houses
the airport and is denoted by a [B].  When a drone has just taken off from
the airport or is attemping to land on the airport, this space will appear
as [D].  Any space that houses a drone will be denoted with as [D] while
any space that does not will appear as empty brackers [ ].
